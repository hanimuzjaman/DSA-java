# Java DSA Repository

This repository is designed as a step-by-step journey to build a strong foundation in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java**.  
We will start with the basics and gradually move towards more complex concepts with implementations and practice problems.

### Learning Path:

1. **Arrays & Strings** â†’ Learn the fundamentals of storing and accessing data.
2. **ArrayList** â†’ Practice dynamic arrays and their advantages over primitive arrays.
3. **Linked List** â†’ Understand node-based structures (singly, doubly, circular).
4. **Stack** â†’ Explore LIFO operations and common use cases.
5. **Queue** â†’ Implement FIFO structures (simple queue, circular queue, priority queue).
6. **Recursion Basics** â†’ Strengthen problem-solving with recursive patterns.
7. **Sorting & Searching** â†’ Implement classic algorithms step by step.
8. **Advanced Practice** â†’ Apply concepts in problems and interview-style exercises.

ðŸ“š **Goal:** By following this path, youâ€™ll gradually strengthen your understanding of DSA in Java, moving from simple implementations to solving real interview-level problems.
